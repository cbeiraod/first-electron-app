    <h1>Owl with glasses</h1>

    <p>
    This owl was generated with Stable Diffusion, using the prompt "Owl in glasses":<br />
    <img src="StableDiffusion.jpeg" width="150px" />
    </p>

    <p>
    I tried using google image search to find if there was an original somewhere, but I could not find anything exactly the same.
    When selecting parts of the image for searching, there were some interesting hits, but nothing exactly the same.
    </p>

    <p>
    I then passed the image through a style GAN, mostly out of curiosity, and obtained the following image:<br />
    <img src="StableDiffusion-animeganv2.png" width="150px" />
    </p>

    <p>
    I am pretty entertained with the results.
